Title: Functions to Compute Compositional Turnover Using Zeta Diversity
Version: 0.1

Description: Functions to compute compositional turnover using zeta-diversity, the number of species shared by multiple assemblages. The package includes a Zeta.order() function to compute zeta-diversity for a specific number of assemblages, and a Zeta.decline() function to compute zeta-diversity for a range of numbers of assemblages. It also includes additional functions to explain how zeta-diversity varies with distance and with differences of environmental variables between assemblages, using linear regressions and generalized additive models.
