Description: Functions to compute compositional turnover using zeta-diversity,
    the number of species shared by multiple assemblages. The package includes
    functions to compute zeta-diversity for a specific number of
    assemblages and to compute zeta-diversity for a range of numbers of
    assemblages. It also includes functions to explain how zeta-diversity
    varies with distance and with differences in environmental variables
    between assemblages, using generalised linear models, linear models
    with negative constraints, generalised additive models,shape
    constrained additive models, and I-splines.
